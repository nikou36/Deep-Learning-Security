## Deep-Learning-Security
# What this project is
A project that uses deep learning to develop a model that can detect whether or not a person has a weapon brandished or not.  
# Motivation
The motivation for this project is to help enhance security systems. If implemented into embedded system, a person could create a security system that will notify the user if it detects a person on its feed with a weapon drawn. 
# Code
This being built model is built using the Tensorflow, and Keras libraries.
